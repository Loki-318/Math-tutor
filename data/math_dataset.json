    "question": "What is an equivalence relation, and how can you verify that a relation is an equivalence relation?",
    "solution": "An equivalence relation on a set A is a relation R that satisfies three properties: reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. To verify that a relation R is an equivalence relation, you check the following:1. Reflexive: For every element a in A, (a, a) ∈ R.  2. Symmetric: If (a, b) ∈ R, then (b, a) ∈ R for all a, b ∈ A.  3. Transitive: If (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R, then (a, c) ∈ R for all a, b, c ∈ A. For example, consider the set of all triangles in a plane with R as the relation 'is congruent to.' This relation is reflexive because every triangle is congruent to itself. It is symmetric because if T₁ is congruent to T₂, then T₂ is congruent to T₁. It is transitive because if T₁ is congruent to T₂ and T₂ is congruent to T₃, then T₁ is congruent to T₃. Therefore, R is an equivalence relation."

    "question": "Let R be the relation defined on the set of all triangles in a plane, where R is given by T₁ is congruent to T₂. Show that R is an equivalence relation.",
    "solution": "To show that R is an equivalence relation, we need to verify that it satisfies the properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity:  1. Reflexive: Every triangle is congruent to itself. Thus, (T₁, T₁) ∈ R, so R is reflexive.  2. Symmetric: If (T₁, T₂) ∈ R, then T₁ is congruent to T₂. By the definition of congruence, T₂ is also congruent to T₁, implying (T₂, T₁) ∈ R. Hence, R is symmetric.   3. Transitive: If (T₁, T₂) ∈ R and (T₂, T₃) ∈ R, then T₁ is congruent to T₂ and T₂ is congruent to T₃. By the transitivity of congruence, T₁ is congruent to T₃, which implies (T₁, T₃) ∈ R. Thus, R is transitive. Since R satisfies reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, it is an equivalence relation."

    "question": "Prove that the relation R on the set of all lines in a plane, defined by L₁ is perpendicular to L₂, is symmetric but neither reflexive nor transitive.",
    "solution": "We verify the properties of the relation R defined as L₁ is perpendicular to L₂: 1. Reflexivity: A line cannot be perpendicular to itself. Therefore, (L₁, L₁) ∉ R, so R is not reflexive. 2. Symmetry: If (L₁, L₂) ∈ R, then L₁ is perpendicular to L₂. By the definition of perpendicularity, L₂ is also perpendicular to L₁, which implies (L₂, L₁) ∈ R. Thus, R is symmetric. 3. Transitivity: If (L₁, L₂) ∈ R and (L₂, L₃) ∈ R, it means L₁ is perpendicular to L₂, and L₂ is perpendicular to L₃. However, L₁ cannot be perpendicular to L₃ because it would make L₁ parallel to L₃. Thus, R is not transitive.Hence, the relation R is symmetric but neither reflexive nor transitive."

    "solution": "We check the properties of the relation R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)}: 1. Reflexivity: For a relation to be reflexive, (a, a) ∈ R for all elements a in {1, 2, 3}. Since (1, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 3) are in R, the relation is reflexive. 2.Symmetry: If (a, b) ∈ R, then (b, a) must also be in R. For example, (1, 2) ∈ R, but (2, 1) ∉ R. Hence, R is not symmetric.3.

    "solution": "We verify the properties of the relation R defined by (a, b) ∈ R if and only if 2 divides (a - b): 1.Reflexivity: For any integer a, 2 divides (a - a) because a - a = 0, and 2 divides 0. Hence, (a, a) ∈ R for all a, so R is reflexive. 2.Symmetry: If (a, b) ∈ R, then 2 divides (a - b). This implies that 2 also divides (b - a) because (b - a) = -(a - b). Therefore, (b, a) ∈ R. Hence, R is symmetric. 3.Transitivity: If (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R, then 2 divides (a - b) and 2 divides (b - c). Adding these, 2 divides [(a - b) + (b - c)] = (a - c). Thus, (a, c) ∈ R.

They are generally represented by (a, b, c), where a, b, and c are proportional to the direction vector of the line. They can be any scalar multiples of the direction vector.\n   - **Direction Cosines:**\n     - Direction cosines are the cosines of the angles that the direction vector of a line makes with the coordinate axes (x, y, z). They are represented by (l, m, n), where l, m, and n are the cosines of the angles that the line makes with the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis respectively.\n\n### 2. **Mathematical Relationship:**\n   - **Direction Ratios:**\n     - Direction ratios (a, b, c) can take any values, and they are not constrained by any particular relationship.\n   - **Direction Cosines:**\n     - Direction cosines (l, m, n) are related by the equation: \\( l^2 + m^2 + n^2 = 1 \\).

    "solution": "Theorem 1 states: \n\"Let R be the feasible region (convex polygon) for a linear programming problem, and let Z = ax + by be the objective function. If the objective function has an optimal value (maximum or minimum), it must occur at a corner point (vertex) of the feasible region.\"\n\n**Explanation**:\n1. In a linear programming problem, the feasible region is defined by a set of linear inequalities. This region is a convex polygon in two-dimensional problems.\n2. The objective function Z = ax + by is linear, meaning its level curves (lines of constant Z) are straight lines.\n3. The optimal value of Z is achieved at one of the corner points (vertices) of the feasible region because:\n   - The level lines of the objective function move parallelly.\n   - The maximum or minimum value of Z occurs at the farthest point of the feasible region in the direction of increasing or decreasing Z.\n4. This theorem simplifies solving linear programming problems, as evaluating Z at the finite set of corner points is sufficient to find the optimal value, rather than testing every point in the feasible region.\n\n**Example**:\nIn a feasible region bounded by four corner points (0, 0), (20, 0), (10, 30), and (0, 40), evaluating Z = 4x + y at these points will yield the optimal solution at one of these vertices."

If R is bounded, then the objective function Z has both a maximum and a minimum value on R, and each of these occurs at a corner point (vertex) of R.\"\n\n**Explanation**:\n1. A bounded feasible region is one that is enclosed within a finite area or volume, meaning it does not extend infinitely in any direction.\n2. Since the feasible region is finite, the level curves of the objective function will intersect the boundary of the feasible region at specific points.\n3. The maximum and minimum values of the objective function will occur at one of the corner points of the feasible region.\n4. This theorem guarantees that if the feasible region is bounded, both the maximum and minimum values of the objective function exist and can be determined by evaluating Z at the corner points.\n\n**Implications**:\n- The bounded nature of the feasible region ensures the existence of optimal solutions.\n- This simplifies problem-solving, as testing the corner points is sufficient to find the maximum and minimum values.\n\n**Example**:\nConsider the feasible region defined by:\n- x + y ≤ 10,\n- 2x + y ≤ 15,\n- x, y ≥ 0.\nThe feasible region is a bounded triangle with corner points (0, 0), (0, 10), and (5, 5).

Otherwise, the system is inconsistent (no solution).\n\n### **Final Answer:**\nThe given system of equations does not have a unique solution because the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero (det(A) = 0). Further analysis is needed to determine if the system is dependent or inconsistent."

The derivative of ( 2x^2 ) is ( 4x ), because the derivative of ( ax^n ), where ( a ) is a constant and ( n ) is the power, is ( anx^{n-1} ).\n2.

Substituting these values:\n[\nDelta = (-6)^2 - 4(3)(4)\n]\n[\nDelta = 36 - 48 = -12\n]\n\nSince the discriminant ( Delta ) is negative, the quadratic equation ( 3x^2 - 6x + 4 ) has no real roots.

Analyze the properties of the function f(x) = 1/(x - 2).\n3. Determine the points where the function is continuous by checking if the conditions of continuity hold.\n\n### Step 1: Definition of Continuity\nA function f(x) is continuous at a point x = a if:\n\n1. f(a) is defined.\n2. The limit of f(x) as x approaches a exists.\n3. The value of f(a) is equal to the limit of f(x) as x approaches a:\n\n   limit of f(x) as x approaches a = f(a).\n\nWe will check if these conditions hold for the function f(x) = 1/(x - 2).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Function\nThe function f(x) = 1/(x - 2) is defined only for x ≠ 2, as division by zero is undefined. Thus, the domain of the function is x in (-∞, 2) union (2, ∞).\n\nThis means that f(x) is not defined at x = 2. We need to check the continuity of f(x) on its domain (-∞, 2) union (2, ∞) and analyze its behavior as x approaches 2.\n\n### Step 3: Continuity on the Domain\n#### Case 1: Continuity for x > 2\nWhen x > 2, the function f(x) = 1/(x - 2) is smooth and well-defined. The limit of f(x) as x approaches any positive number a > 2 is:\n\n   limit of f(x) as x approaches a = 1/(a - 2).\n\nSince f(a) = 1/(a - 2), the function is continuous for x > 2.\n\n#### Case 2: Continuity for x < 2\nWhen x < 2, the function f(x) = 1/(x - 2) is also smooth and well-defined. The limit of f(x) as x approaches any negative number a < 2 is:\n\n   limit of f(x) as x approaches a = 1/(a - 2).\n\nSince f(a) = 1/(a - 2), the function is continuous for x < 2.\n\n### Step 4: Behavior at x = 2\nAt x = 2, the function f(x) = 1/(x - 2) is undefined. To analyze the behavior of f(x) as x approaches 2, we compute the left-hand limit (LHL) and right-hand limit (RHL):\n\n1. **Left-hand limit (LHL):**\n   \n   limit of f(x) as x approaches 2 from the left = limit of 1/(x - 2) as x approaches 2 from the left.\n\n   As x approaches 2 from the left (x < 2), the denominator (x - 2) becomes increasingly negative, and f(x) tends to -∞.\n\n2. **Right-hand limit (RHL):**\n\n   limit of f(x) as x approaches 2 from the right = limit of 1/(x - 2) as x approaches 2 from the right.\n\n   As x approaches 2 from the right (x > 2), the denominator (x - 2) becomes increasingly positive, and f(x) tends to ∞.\n\nSince the left-hand limit and right-hand limit are not equal and do not converge to a finite value, the two-sided limit does not exist at x = 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function f(x) = 1/(x - 2) is continuous for all x ≠ 2, as it satisfies the conditions of continuity on its domain. However, it is not defined at x = 2, and the limit of f(x) as x approaches 2 does not exist. Thus, f(x) is not continuous at x = 2."

We need to check the following:\n\n1. **f(-1) is defined:**\n\n   Since x = -1 falls under the case x ≤ -1, we use f(x) = x³ + 2:\n\n   f(-1) = (-1)³ + 2 = -1 + 2 = 1.\n\n   Thus, f(-1) is defined and equals 1.\n\n2. **The limit of f(x) as x approaches -1 exists:**\n\n   - **Left-hand limit (LHL):**\n     When x approaches -1 from the left (x ≤ -1), we use f(x) = x³ + 2:\n\n     limit of f(x) as x approaches -1 from the left = (-1)³ + 2 = -1 + 2 = 1.\n\n   - **Right-hand limit (RHL):**\n     When x approaches -1 from the right (x > -1), we use f(x) = 2x + 1:\n\n     limit of f(x) as x approaches -1 from the right = 2(-1) + 1 = -2 + 1 = -1.\n\nSince LHL = 1 and RHL = -1, the two-sided limit does not exist.\n\n3. **Compare f(-1) with the limit:**\n\n   While f(-1) = 1 is defined, the two-sided limit does not exist because LHL ≠ RHL. Thus, f(x) is discontinuous at x = -1.\n\n### Step 4: Check Continuity at x = 0\nAt x = 0, the function is defined as f(0) = 0. We need to check the following:\n\n1. **f(0) is defined:**\n\n   By the definition of the function, f(0) = 0. Hence, f(0) is defined.\n\n2. **The limit of f(x) as x approaches 0 exists:**\n\n   - **Left-hand limit (LHL):**\n     When x approaches 0 from the left (x ≤ -1), we use f(x) = x³ + 2. The left-hand limit does not apply because the domain of f(x) for x ≤ -1 does not cover the vicinity of x = 0.\n\n   - **Right-hand limit (RHL):**\n     When x approaches 0 from the right (x > -1), we use f(x) = 2x + 1. Similarly, the right-hand limit does not lead to ambiguity because the function is well-defined at 0.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe function f(x) = {x³ + 2, if x ≤ -1; 0, if x = 0; 2x + 1, if x > -1} is discontinuous only at x = -1. There is no ambiguity for x transition."

    "solution": "Using Heron’s formula. s = (122 + 22 + 120) / 2 = 132 m. Now calculate s - a, s - b, and s - c: s - a = 132 - 122 = 10 m, s - b = 132 - 22 = 110 m, s - c = 132 - 120 = 12 m. Using Heron’s formula: Area = √(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)) = √(132 × 10 × 110 × 12) = √1742400 ≈ 1320 m². The annual rent per m² is ₹5000, so for a 3-month period: Rent = 1320 m² × ₹5000 × (3/12) = ₹1650000. Thus, the rent for 3 months is ₹1650000."

In quadrilateral OAPB, the sum of all interior angles is 360°.\nThus,\n∠OPA + ∠OPB + ∠AOB + ∠APB = 360°.\n90° + 90° + ∠AOB + ∠APB = 360°.\n∠AOB + ∠APB = 180°.\nTherefore, the angle between the tangents (∠APB) is supplementary to the angle subtended by the line segment AB at the center (∠AOB)."

    "solution": "The word 'ROOT' consists of four letters, where 'O' appears twice and the other letters are unique. To find the number of distinct arrangements, we use the formula for arrangements of letters with repeated elements: Total arrangements = n! / (p1! * p2! * ... * pk!). Here, n = 4 (total letters), and the letter 'O' repeats 2 times, so: Distinct arrangements = 4! / 2!. Expanding factorials: = (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (2 * 1) = 24 / 2 = 12. Therefore, there are 12 distinct ways to arrange the letters of the word 'ROOT'."

    "solution": "To form a 4-digit number using the digits 1 to 9 without repetition, we consider each position in the number: For the first digit, we have 9 choices (digits 1 to 9). For the second digit, we have 8 remaining choices. For the third digit, 7 choices remain. For the fourth digit, 6 choices are left. Thus, the number of 4-digit numbers we can form is 9 multiplied by 8 multiplied by 7 multiplied by 6, which gives 3024. Therefore, 3024 distinct 4-digit numbers can be formed using the digits 1 to 9 without repetition."

    "solution": "We have a total of 9 discs, consisting of 4 red, 3 yellow, and 2 green discs, and we need to find the number of distinct arrangements when discs of the same color are indistinguishable. The formula for arrangements when there are groups of identical items is: Total arrangements = factorial of the total number of items divided by the product of the factorials of each group count. Total arrangements = factorial of 9 divided by (factorial of 4 multiplied by factorial of 3 multiplied by factorial of 2). factorial of 9 is 362880. factorial of 4 is 24. factorial of 3 is 6. factorial of 2 is 2. Therefore: Total arrangements = 362880 divided by (24 multiplied by 6 multiplied by 2) = 362880 / 288 = 1260. Thus, there are 1260 distinct ways to arrange the 4 red, 3 yellow, and 2 green discs in a row."

Total arrangements without restrictions: There are 8! ways to arrange 8 people. 8! = 40320. Arrangements with the two specific people together: Consider the two people as a single unit, so we have 7 units to arrange. Arrangements of these 7 units = 7! = 5040. Now, the two people within the unit can switch places in 2 ways, so total arrangements with the two people together = 5040 × 2 = 10080. Arrangements where the two specific people are not together: Subtract the cases where they are together from the total arrangements: 40320 - 10080 = 30240. Therefore, there are 30240 ways to arrange the 8 people such that the two specific people do not sit next to each other."

Proof: The proof is obtained by applying the principle of mathematical induction. Let the given statement be P(n): (a + b)^n = nC0 a^n + nC1 a^(n-1)b + nC2 a^(n-2)b^2 + ... + nCn-1 a b^(n-1) + nCnb^n. Step 1: Base Case (n = 1) For n = 1, we have P(1): (a + b)^1 = 1C0 a^1 + 1C1 b^1 = a + b. Thus, P(1) is true. Step 2: Suppose P(k) is true for some positive integer k, i.e., (a + b)^k = kC0 a^k + kC1 a^(k-1)b + kC2 a^(k-2)b^2 + ... + kCk b^k  ...(1) We shall prove that P(k + 1) is also true, i.e., (a + b)^(k + 1) = (k + 1)C0 a^(k+1) + (k + 1)C1 a^k b + (k + 1)C2 a^(k-1)b^2 + ... + (k + 1)Ck+1 b^(k+1).

    "solution": "To prove that (6^n - 5^n) leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 25, we expand 6^n using the binomial theorem. Step 1: Expand (6^n) We write (6) as (5+1), so: [6^n = (5+1)^n]. Using the binomial theorem: [ (5 + 1)^n = C(n, 0)5^n + C(n, 1)5^{n-1}(1) + C(n, 2)5^{n-2}(1)^2 + ….. + C(n, n)(1)^n]. Here, C(n, r) represents the combination (n! / [r!(n-r)!]). Simplifying this expansion: [ 6^n = 5^n + n5^{n-1} + [n(n-1)/2]5^{n-2} + ….. ]. Step 2: Subtract (5^n) from (6^n). When we subtract (5^n), the remaining terms are: [ 6^n - 5^n = n5^{n-1} + [n(n-1)/2]5^{n-2} + ……]. Step 3: Simplify modulo 25. For n ≥ 2, all terms starting from n5^(n-1) contain factors of 25 or higher powers of 5. Therefore, these terms are multiples of 25 and contribute nothing to the remainder when dividing by 25. The only term that remains is 1, which comes from the constant term in the binomial expansion. Conclusion: [ 6^n - 5^n = 25k + 1], where k is an integer. Therefore, (6^n - 5^n) always leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 25."

    "question": "What is the slope of a line, how is it defined, and how can it be calculated using two points on the line?",
    "solution": "The slope (or gradient) of a line is a measure of its steepness and is defined as the tangent of the angle ( θ ) that the line makes with the positive x-axis, measured counterclockwise. The slope is represented by ( m ) and is given by:  m = tan( θ )    Important Cases: 1. For a line parallel to the x-axis, the angle ( θ = 0° ), so the slope ( m = 0 ).\n 2. For a line parallel to the y-axis (vertical), the angle ( θ= 90° ), and the slope is undefined because ( tan 90° ) is undefined. Finding the Slope Using Two Points  If two points on the line are given, say P(x₁, y₁) and Q(x₂, y₂), we can calculate the slope of the line as: [ m = {y₂ - y₁} / {x₂ - x₁} ] This formula calculates the slope by dividing the change in the y-coordinates by the change in the x-coordinates between the two points.** Example: Given points P(3, 4)  and Q(7, 10) :  m = {10 - 4} / {7 - 3}  = {6} / {4} = 1.5 Thus, the slope of the line passing through points P(3, 4) and Q(7, 10) is 1.5."

Conditions for Perpendicular Lines: If two non-vertical lines l₁ and l₂ are perpendicular, then the product of their slopes is -1.

Obtuse Angle: The obtuse angle (ϕ) between the lines can be calculated by using: ϕ = 180° − θ. Example: If the angle between two lines is (45°) and the slope of one line is 2, find the slope of the other line. Using the formula: [ tan(45°) = (m - 2) / (1 + 2m) ]. Since (tan(45°) = 1), we get: [ 1 = (m - 2) / (1 + 2m) ]. This gives two equations: m - 2 = 1 + 2m or m - 2 = -(1 + 2m). Solving these gives m = -3 or m = -1/3.

    "solution": "1. First, calculate the mean (x̄) using the formula:  x̄  =  ∑ fi xi/ ∑fi} . ∑fi = 7+10+15+10+6 = 48 . ∑fi = {7(3) + 10(8) + 15(13) + 10(18) + 6(23)}/{7 + 10 + 15 + 10 + 6} =   13. Then, compute the variance (σ²) using the formula:    σ² = ∑fi (xi - x̄ )2/∑fi . To calculate the variance (σ²):  Use the formula for variance:  σ² = ∑fᵢ(xᵢ - x̄)² / ∑fᵢ.  Calculate the squared deviations for each value: For x₁ = 3,     (3 - 13)² = 100,      so f₁(3 - 13)² = 7 × 100 = 700.For x₂ = 8,       (8 - 13)² = 25,     so f₂(8 - 13)² = 10 × 25 = 250.For x₃ = 13,     (13 - 13)² = 0,     so f₃(13 - 13)² = 15 × 0 = 0.For x₄ = 18,      (18 - 13)² = 25,  so f₄(18 - 13)² = 10 × 25 = 250. For x₅ = 23,  (23 - 13)² = 100,  so f₅(23 - 13)² = 6 × 100 = 600.Sum of the squared deviations: 700 + 250 + 0 + 250 + 600 = 1800.Now, compute the variance:  σ² = 1800 / 48 = 37.5."
